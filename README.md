## About

This is a demo application that utilizes the official React template generated by the Wails CLI tool. It is meant to be a baseline for developers new to Wails and desktop development looking to use React-based frameworks to create modern-looking standalone applications.

**The application uses not only standard React components, but also customized ones offered by the free and open source MDB React UI Kit**

You can configure the project by editing `wails.json`. More information about the project settings can be found
here: https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
